> The width and height of the class boxes should be specified as named constants
so that they are easy to change.
> The labels should be centered in their boxes. You can find the width of a label by
calling label.getWidth() and the height it extends above the baseline by calling
label.getAscent(). If you want to center a label, you need to shift its origin by
half of these distances in each direction.
> The connecting lines should start and end at the center of the appropriate edge of
the box.
> The entire figure should be centered in the window
